        <h1>Festival</h1>
        <p style="color: #e72c30;">A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some
            characteristic aspect of that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or
            national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well as the high
            culture-low culture interrelationship. Next to religion and folklore, a significant origin is agricultural.
            Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time.</p>

        <h1>Cricket</h1>
        <p style="color: blue">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at
            the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
            balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the
            bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by
            preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter
            (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges
            the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits
            the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.
            When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by
            two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>

        <h1>Football</h1>
        <p style="color: brown; font-size: large">Association football, more commonly known as simply football or
            soccer,is a team sport played with a spherical ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by
            approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular
            sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the
            game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing
            goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more minutes.</p>
