        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: #000716;"><u><b><i>H</i></b>arry Potter</u> was
            a series of books authored by one of the most eminent writers of our generation,
            <u>J.K. Rowling</u>. These books showcase the wizarding world and its workings.
            <u>J.K. Rowling</u> has been so successful at weaving a picture of this world, that it feels real.
            Although the series contains seven books, I have a particular favourite. My favourite book from the series
            is
            The Goblet of fire. When I started reading the book, it caught my attention instantly.
            Even though I had read all the previous parts, none of the books caught my attention as this one did.
            It gave a larger perspective into the wizarding world. One of the things which excite me the most
            about this book is the introduction of the other wizard schools. The concept of the Tri-wizard
            tournament is one of the most brilliant pieces I have come across in the
            <u>Harry Potter</u> series. In addition, this book also contains some of my favourite characters.
            The moment I read about Hermoine Granger entry, I was star struck.
            The aura and personality of that character described by <u>Rowling</u>
            are simply brilliant. Further, it made me become a greater fan of the series.
